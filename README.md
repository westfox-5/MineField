#  How to play

First download the game using this command:
    
    git clone https://github.com/westfox-5/MineField

Then compile all the sources:

    make install
This creates a `dist` folder, in which there are compiled files and the executable named `campo` .
<br>
Do these last two things:

* Add permissions to the executable file:

       sudo chmod u+x dist/campo

* Set your terminal fullscreen or maximize it.

## Now just play and enjoy!

        ./dist/campo
